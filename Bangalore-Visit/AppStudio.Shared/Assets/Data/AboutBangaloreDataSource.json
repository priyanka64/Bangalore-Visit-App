The word Bengalooru was in turn derived from the phrase 'bende kaalu ooru', meaning 'the town of boiled beans'. The story behind naming the city as the 'town of boiled beans' is said Once a hunting expedition King Ballala of the Hoysala dynasty lost his way in the jungle. Deep inside the jungle, lived an old woman who took pity on the hungry and tired hunter. The old woman was poor and had nothing else to offer but boiled beans. But the king was so pleased with her hospitality that he named the entire city as bele-benda-kalu-ooru.<br><br><br>"
